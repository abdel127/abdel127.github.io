<p>Travelz allows a group of people traveling together to collaboratively build their shared travel journal/story. Others can search for and view the story as it unfolds. It allows all co-travelers to add new entries (containing text and images) to a shared journal. Entries are marked with the login name of the creator and timestamp of creation. As more and more entries are created, the group sees their shared memories unfold, and preserved for years to come.
Complete UX and UI design of the website was created by the project team I was in. Development and publishing was also done by the same team.</p>

<p>A recipes page that will allow for the creation of a recipe list: You can enter recipes that you have made in the past or want to make in the future, and they will all be displayed in one convenient place. Each time you cook a recipe, you can log that in as an &ldquo;attempt&rdquo;, with its own rating on how it turned out, and any notes of things you could change in the future. You can filter your recipes by &ldquo;wishlist&rdquo; (to view untested recipes), number of times made, rating, etc.
